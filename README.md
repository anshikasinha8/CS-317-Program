# CS 317 Program 1

Processor: Apple M4

This is my code for CS 317 Prgramming Assignment 1.

## Requirements: 
- Prompt the user for the name of the input and output text files.
- Read up to 100000 words from a file into an array of strings.
- Sort the words using Quicksort. The string comparisons should be case-insensitive.
- Use Hoareâ€™s partition algorithm, where the first value in the array is used as the pivot value.
- Compute the elapsed time for the sort.
- Print the sorted data to the output file. (Prompt the user for the number of words per line)
- Take your newly sorted array and run Quicksort on it again.
- Compute the % time longer it takes to sort the ordered list.
- The solution must be written in C++ version 17 (not 20 or higher!)
